# Quiz Generation App

This application is built using Streamlit and integrates with the Anthropic LLM to generate quizzes from 
user-uploaded documents. The application allows users to specify parameters such as the number of questions, 
difficulty level, and question types. The generated quizzes are stored in a database and can be accessed later 
using a unique UUID.

- Configure quiz parameters:
  - **Quiz Name**: Customize the title of your quiz
